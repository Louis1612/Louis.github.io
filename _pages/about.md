## About Me

Hi, I'm Luyi Lin (林路易), a 1st-year Ph.D./MS.c student at PKU, fortunately advised by Prof.Bin Cui.

I received my Bachelor's degree from the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Beijing Jiaotong University, where I gained a basic understanding of AI research under the guidance of Wenjuan Han.

I have a **I believe that in research, ultimately, everything boils down to solid foundations, discerning  tastes and audacious insights.** My mission in research is to build advanced and scalable intelligence. Currently my research focuses on: 
- System-level optimization for efficient model training

  TODO: give a more specific description about this topic (I hope to make intelligence cheaper...)

- Exploration of promising hardware-efficient model architecture

  TODO: give a more specific description about this topic

## Personal Hobbies
Beyond science, I read literature and I love films. I've watched several works created by Andrei Tarkovsky.

I've been deeply influenced by Lacanian psychoanalysis. And in the future, I plan to read the thoughts of Hegel and Louis Althusser.
